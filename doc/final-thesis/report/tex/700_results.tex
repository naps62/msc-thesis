\chapter{Profiling Results} \label{chapter:results}

%Prior to the beginning the work on the implementations previously described, an analysis was made on the already existing version, mostly to understand its scalability across different computational systems. Since this was an external product, its usage was limited to serving as a validation tool for future implementations, as well as settings expectations on how the algorithm should perform.

Initial analysis was focused on studying the scalability of both \cpu and \cuda versions without the help of any framework. This provided a reference to evaluate the overhead of using the framework. When using the \starpu framework, different schedulers were tested, particularly \textbf{peager} and \textbf{pheft} due to their awareness of combined workers, which allows \openmp parallelization within \cpu tasks. \textbf{dm} and \textbf{dmda} were also tested, to analyse the impact of memory transfers in the performance model of a scheduler.
