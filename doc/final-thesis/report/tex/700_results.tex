\chapter{Profiling Results} \label{chapter:results}

Prior to the beginning the work on the implementations previously described, an analysis was made on the already existing version, mostly to understand its scalability across different computational systems. Since this was an external product, its usage was limited to serving as a validation tool for future implementations, as well as settings expectations on how the algorithm should perform.

Later stages involved the profiling using only the versions actually produced during this dissertation, where code is shared whenever possible between the different versions, producing more comparable profiling results
