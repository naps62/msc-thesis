\section{Document Organization}

\Cref{chapter:back} provides background information relevant to fully contextualize the reader about the technologies and issues being studied. \Cref{chapter:frameworks} introduces the two analysed frameworks, and explains their purpose, features and the methodologies behind them.

\Cref{chapter:case_study} presents the progressive photon mapping algorithm, the selected case study, to evaluate the frameworks. An initial background on ray tracing and its evolution is given, followed by the presentation of the algorithm, and its evolutions in the context of this work.

\Cref{chapter:impl,chapter:results} focus on the actual work developing the case study, particularly the implementation using \starpu, and its subsequent profiling. Initial scalability results and their analysis are presented along with some considerations regarding the performance of \starpu, as well as the issues found along the way.

Finally, \cref{chapter:conclusions} presents the final conclusions of this work, and \cref{chapter:future} leaves suggestions of future work on relevant topics that could not be fully covered during this dissertation.
