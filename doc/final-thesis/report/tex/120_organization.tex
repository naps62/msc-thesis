\section{Document Organization}

\Cref{chapter:back} provides background information relevant to fully contextualize reader about the technologies and issues being studied. \Cref{chapter:gama,chapter:starpu} introduces the two analyzed frameworks, and explains their purpose, features and the methodologies behind them.

\Cref{chapter:case_study} presents the Progressive Photon Mapping algorithm, here being used as a case study. An initial background on ray tracing and its evolution is given, following by the presentation of the algorithm itself, and the evolutions it has suffered.

\Cref{chapter:impl,chapter:results} focus on the actual work developing the case study, particularly the implementation using \starpu, and their subsequent profiling. Initial scalability results and their analysis are presented, along with some considerations regarding the performance of \starpu, as well as the issues encountered along the way.

Finally, \cref{chapter:conclusions} presents the final conclusions of this work, and leaves suggestions of future work, on topics that, although interesting, were not fully covered during this dissertation.
