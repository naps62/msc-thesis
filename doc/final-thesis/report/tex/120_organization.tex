\section{Document Organization}

\Cref{chapter:back} provides background information relevant to fully contextualize the reader about the technologies and issues being studied. \Cref{chapter:frameworks} introduces the two analyzed frameworks, and explains their purpose, features and the methodologies behind them.

\Cref{chapter:case_study} presents the Progressive Photon Mapping algorithm, here being used as a case study. An initial background on ray tracing and its evolution is given, followed by the presentation of the algorithm itself, and the evolutions it has suffered.

\Cref{chapter:impl,chapter:results} focus on the actual work developing the case study, particularly the implementation using \starpu, and its subsequent profiling. Initial scalability results and their analysis are presented.

Finally, \cref{chapter:conclusions} presents the final conclusions of this work, and \cref{chapter:future} leaves suggestions of future work on topics that, although interesting, were not fully covered during this dissertation.
