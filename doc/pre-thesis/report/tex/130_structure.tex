\subsection{Document structure}

\Cref{section:back} describes the literature search made during the initial work stages of this dissertation, as well as some technologies that will be useful (or potentially useful) in later work. \Cref{section:gama} shows the initial analysis of the \gama framework, and presents some concepts and considerations, based on sample code study and hands-on experiments with a couple of small test cases. \Cref{section:photon} describes in greater detail the rogressive photon mapping algorithm, which will be used as the main case study for the rest of this dissertation, to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages, as well as potential of \gama. Finally, \cref{section:conc} presents some initial conclusions and explains the line of work to be followed for the remaining dissertation work.
