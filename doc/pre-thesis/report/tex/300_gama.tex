\section{The \gama Framework} \label{section:gama}

The \acf{GAMA} is a framework to aid computational scientists in the development or porting of data-parallel applications to heterogeneous computing platforms. Currently \hetplat support includes only systems composed of traditional \cpus cores and one or several CUDA-capable \gpu devices.

\gama provides an abstraction of the hardware platform, attempting to free the programmer from the workload scheduling and data movement issues across the different resources. In \gama, an application is composed of a collection of jobs, each defined as a set of tasks applied to a different input data set. Every job shares a global address space, instead of directly using the private memory of each device.
