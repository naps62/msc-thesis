\section{Methodology}

In a first stage, the main focus will be in the research and study of the progressive photon mapping algorithm to better comprehend its details, and in experimental work with GAMA to fully understand the framework. Some time will also be spent studying existing implementations of the case study.

The second stage will focus on implementing the test case using GAMA. This is expected to be the most time consuming task, and a good understanding of the algorithm from the previous stage will be essential.  Other implementations will also be studied, not only to assist in the development, but also to serve as a comparison basis for future analysis.

  In the third stage, a deeper analysis will be done, which should be assisted by the previously gained knowledge. This stage will be essential to determine the effectiveness of GAMA, and to understand how to develop it further.

It will also be interesting, if time allows it, to study the possibilities and limitations of extending GAMA by providing support for additional architectures other than GPU's.
