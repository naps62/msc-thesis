Current high performance computing platforms consist of different architectures working together and sharing workload to deliver higher computational power. These platforms, usually called Heterogeneous Platforms, typically consist of one or more multi-core CPU, and other devices, such as massively parallel architectures like Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), or event more specialized architectures like Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) or Digital Signal Processors (DSPs).

The heterogeneous nature of this platforms difficults their efficient usage, since each different architecture possesses different characteristics, and requires a different programming model
