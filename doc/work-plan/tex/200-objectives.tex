The main goal of this dissertation is to perform a deep study of the GAMA framework, and identify possible aspects that should be improved in its implementation. These comes down to two possible problems:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Programming limitations:} Understand wether the framework enforces any limitation as to what the programmer is able to do, and if that can have any effect on the usability of the framework;
  \item \textbf{Performance issues:} Assert wether or not the framework behaves poorly for any particular application, effectively reducing its efficiency, when compared to its non-GAMA counterpart? Why does it happen, and how can it be solved?
\end{itemize}

To achieve this, a case study with appropriate complexity will be implemented using the framework. The selected case study is the Progressive Photon Mapping algorithm. This algorithm
