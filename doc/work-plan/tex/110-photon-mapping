\subsection{Progressive Photon Mapping as a Case Study}

In order to properly analyse the GAMA framework, the Photon Mapping algorithm was chosen as case study. This algorithm is a Ray Tracing method, and as such, attempts to solve the rendering equation \cite{kajiya1986rendering} by computing global illumination in two passes:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item First, rays are traced from set of light sources in the scene, in order to construct a photon map representing the global illumination distribution.
  \item In the second pass, the previously generated photon map is used to compute the estimated radiance for each output pixel. Direct and indirect illumination
\end{enumerate}

This technique is used to realistically simulate light effects, and the interaction of light particles with different objects, allowing for effects such as Subsurface Scattering, or Caustics, to be faithfully represented. This was impossible, or very
