\todox{Work Method}

In a first phase, some time will be spent understanding the programming model introduced by GAMA. Previous work about this and other GPU-aware frameworks will be used to assess the state of the art in HetPlats programming. The Progressive Photon Mapping algorithm will also be studied, to better understand its implementation and prepare the next phase. The second phase will be focused on the implementation of the Photon Mapping algorithm using the GAMA framework. During this phase, other implementations of the same algorithm should be used as reference, to ensure that the most optimized methods are used, and the final implementation can be compared against existing implementations. The final implementation should then be benchmarked and compared against existing implementations. Finally, and using the knowledge gained from the work implementing the case study using GAMA, and the benchmarks of the implementation, there should be enough information to identify possible aspects where GAMA should be improved.
