\subsection{GAMA}

The GAMA (GPU And Multicore Aware) framework is a tool that provides the mechanisms required to efficiently execute data-parallel applications in a Heterogeneous Platform. It works as an abstraction layer above the hardware, moving the programmer away from the task of scheduling the workload across the multiple resources available. In GAMA, an application is a collection of ordered jobs, each of which is composed of several tasks that are applied to different data sets. All memory is abstracted into a global address space, working as a distributed shared memory system \cite{ricardo2012gama}
